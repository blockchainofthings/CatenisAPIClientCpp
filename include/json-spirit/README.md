# JSON Spirit

The header files included in this directory are part of the JSON Spirit open-source project &mdash; a C++ JSON Parser/Generator
library implemented with Boost Spirit. They comprise the header-only (template) implementation of the library, and are only needed when
building the Boost ASIO version of the Catenis API C++ client library.

For more information about the JSON Spirit project, please refer to its [code repository on GitHub](https://github.com/png85/json_spirit).
